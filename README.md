# Python API What's the Weather Like?

## Background

Applying Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"


## Part I - WeatherPy

Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. Utilizing a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Linear regression on each relationship, separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):
* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


**Next** Creation of a multiple linear regression plots. 

Your final notebook:
* Randomly select **at least** 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
* Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
* Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
* Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.

### Part II - VacationPy

Applying jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API to plan future vacations.

* Heat map that displays the humidity for every city from the part I.

* Narrow down the DataFrame to find the ideal weather condition.

* Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.

* Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the **Hotel Name**, **City**, and **Country**.
